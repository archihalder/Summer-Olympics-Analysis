<h1 align='center'>Summer-Olympics-Analysis</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
A web application for the analysis of Summer Olympics

---

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>
This is a historical <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results">dataset</a> on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. </p>
<p>
Note that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four year cycle starting with 1994, then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on. A common mistake people make when analyzing this data is to assume that the Summer and Winter Games have always been staggered.
